		<label>tox yam plant</label>

		<label>glowing parasol bush</label>
		<description>A mutated breed of the parasol mushroom bush, adapted to grow in highly polluted environments. It has a much softer stem than its cousin, which can no longer be harvested for wood. The flesh however is perfectly edible, though the eerie green glow prevents many from even trying to eat it. Can only grow on ash rich ground that has been sufficiently polluted.</description>
