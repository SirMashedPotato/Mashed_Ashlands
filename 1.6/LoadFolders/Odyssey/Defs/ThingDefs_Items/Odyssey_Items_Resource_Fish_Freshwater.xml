		<description>A primitive lobe-finned fish, only found in volcanic rashland regions. While they are usually found in lakes and sulphur pools, they can sometimes be found hopping around on land.\n\nSome local tribes have tales of giant foyoda hoppers, that swim in pools of lava. Of course no one has actually caught a foyoda hopper of such grandiose size.</description>

And a few even claim to have encountered marsh angler deep at sea large enough to predate whales.</description>
